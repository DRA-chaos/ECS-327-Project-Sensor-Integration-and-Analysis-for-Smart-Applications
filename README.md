# ECS-327-Project-Sensor-Integration-and-Analysis-for-Smart-Applications

This repository hosts the  project corresponding to the Lab Course ECS 327 of the fifth semester that was carried out under the esteemed guidance of Dr Mitradip Bhattacharjee, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, IISER Bhopal.

## Abstract
Industrial progress is quintessential for the economic development of any country. India especially, being a developing country values industries as its economic barometer. Associated with Industrial acumen are factors like technical infrastructure, scientific task forces etc. Such set-ups make it indispensable to monitor the ambience quantified by temperature and humidity in order to ensure smooth functioning. Improper monitoring of these parameters have led to several tragedies in the past like minor explosions in factory establishments or wastage of factory produce, transportation issues etc. In this project, we explore the use of sensor integration using a DHT11 sensor and Arduino microcontroller board to determine the temperature and relative humidity of a given setting.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to understand the working and underpinnings of the Internet of Things, specifically the use of Arduino Uno and its vast capabilities that make it easily integrable with various sensors and other softwares. This project also explores the use of the Arduino Programming Language which is a framework built on top of C++ (we have used the Arduino IDE in this project). The aim is to develop a conducive framework that outputs the relative humidity and temperature of the surrounding environment.

## Introduction
The term IoT (Internet of things) is an umbrella term used to describe physical objects or groups of such objects that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communication networks. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of things. IoT is most closely associated with “Smart sensing and its applications” off-late owing to a surge in the consumer market. IoT is versatile in the sense that it finds applications in a wide array of fields ranging from Thermodynamics, Healthcare, High energy physics, Astronomy, Telecommunications etc to name a few. In this project, the Arduino , which is an open source hardware, has been used. The Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board that functions like a mini computer to develop necessary interaction with programming software and IDEs. We integrate the DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor with the Arduino Uno to obtain the relative humidity and temperature of the surroundings.

Temperature is one of the most important measurement parameters that is used for monitoring and control in various industries.Temperature sensors are employed for a broad variety of practical purposes across many industries throughout the world. Essentially, these sensors provide input to a system in order to either approximately or accurately determine the temperature of a particular object or environment. From food processing to medical applications, to petrochemical handling and automotive monitoring, to biological research and geological studies, to HVAC systems and other consumer electronics, temperature sensors are a crucial tool in countless fieldsLikewise, humidity is also an important parameter.

Humidity is defined as the amount of water vapor in the air. The most commonly used term is “relative humidity” (RH) as this quantity is relative to the temperature. Throughout the history of relative humidity measurement, there have been numerous approaches to the task. Early hygrometers would measure the physical changes of different materials that would absorb water vapor, and examples included animal hair and paper coils. These methods proved to be inaccurate, with limited measurement range and high maintenance requirements. Other methods of calculating the relative humidity were then developed and some are still used today, such as the sling psychrometer and the chilled mirror hygrometer. These methods use evaporation and condensation to measure and calculate the humidity levels indirectly, but they are not always ideal. As demand grew for more accurate and full-range relative humidity measurements in weather and research applications, a more accurate and low-maintenance solution was needed.   After the invention of the transistor, the first electrical humidity sensors were then developed. These sensors were based on measuring electrical resistance, where a material would absorb water vapor and their resistance changed accordingly. These sensors also had their drawbacks, such as poor stability, limited accuracy, and difficulty responding to decreasing humidity levels, also known as hysteresis.

This project hence aims to build a subtle prototype of a temperature and humidity sensor that can help monitor these parameters. The proposed set-up is cost-effective and is easy to implement considering its ease of integration with the IDE.
