# ECS---327-Project-Sensor-Integration-and-Analysis-for-Smart-Applications

This repository hosts the  project corresponding to the Lab Course ECS 327 of the fifth semester that was carried out under the esteemed guidance of Dr Mitradip Bhattacharjee, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, IISER Bhopal.

## Abstract
Industrial progress is quintessential for the economic development of any country. India especially, being a developing country values industries as its economic barometer. Associated with Industrial acumen are factors like technical infrastructure, scientific task forces etc. Such set-ups make it indispensable to monitor the ambience quantified by temperature and humidity in order to ensure smooth functioning. Improper monitoring of these parameters have led to several tragedies in the past like minor explosions in factory establishments or wastage of factory produce, transportation issues etc. In this project, we explore the use of sensor integration using a DHT11 sensor and Arduino microcontroller board to determine the temperature and relative humidity of a given setting.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to understand the working and underpinnings of the Internet of Things, specifically the use of Arduino Uno and its vast capabilities that make it easily integrable with various sensors and other softwares. This project also explores the use of the Arduino Programming Language which is a framework built on top of C++ (we have used the Arduino IDE in this project). The aim is to develop a conducive framework that outputs the relative humidity and temperature of the surrounding environment.

## Introduction
The term IoT (Internet of things) is an umbrella term used to describe physical objects or groups of such objects that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communication networks. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of things. IoT is most closely associated with “Smart sensing and its applications” off-late owing to a surge in the consumer market. IoT is versatile in the sense that it finds applications in a wide array of fields ranging from Thermodynamics, Healthcare, High energy physics, Astronomy, Telecommunications etc to name a few. In this project, the Arduino , which is an open source hardware, has been used. The Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board that functions like a mini computer to develop necessary interaction with programming software and IDEs. We integrate the DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor with the Arduino Uno to obtain the relative humidity and temperature of the surroundings.
